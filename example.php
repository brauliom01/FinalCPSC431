// You can use .htaccess to clean up the request URL to something like api/example/123 instead. It's optional. 
function GET (Handler $h)  // GOOD //

    $myQuery = "CALL create_record_procedure(:name,:age)";
    
    // Use a special PHP Associative Array for named parameters. The key names should start with a colon too.

    // NOTE: We do NOT have an ID. You shouldn't need an ID to create a record, your MySQL DB can do that. 
    // The exception is if you want to generate your IDs in PHP for some reason. I don't recommend it. 

    // Prepare the query

    // Execute the query, use the $parameters variable as the parameter. 

    // Fetch the query results

    // Return JSON (or some type of "success" response)
    // You're creating a record. It would be wise to return the record itself so you're 100% sure it worked. 
    // You could also just assume it worked and return a success message.

// This function executes if you create a fetch() request to api/example.php and use "PUT" as the method
function PUT(Handler $handler)

    // The PUT function is identical to the POST function with one difference: The ID. 
    // With PUT we are updating a record that should exist so you NEED to have the ID for this one. 
    // It can be part of the URL or it can just be part of the payload (data) sent from the client.
